          <p>
            The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen's memory the triumph of
            their brazen bells: ET UNAM SANCTAM CATHOLICAM ET APOSTOLICAM ECCLESIAM:
            the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts,
            a chemistry of stars. Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope
            Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and
            behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and
            menaced her heresiarchs.

            His hand turned the page over. He leaned back and went on again,
            having just remembered. Of him that walked the waves. Here also over
            these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer's heart and lips
            and on mine. It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the
            tribute. To Caesar what is Caesar's, to God what is God's. A long look
            from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church's
            looms. Ay.

            On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting
            prices on their gemmed fingers. Gabble of geese. They swarmed loud,
            uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk
            hats. Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures. Their full
            slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew
            the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain. Vain patience
            to heap and hoard. Time surely would scatter all. A hoard heaped by the
            roadside: plundered and passing on. Their eyes knew their years of
            wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.
